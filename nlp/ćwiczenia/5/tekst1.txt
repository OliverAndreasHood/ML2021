It was one of the most absurd (and spectacular) deaths in Polish series. Do you remember On November 7, 2011, the face of Polish series changed irreversibly: Dwójka aired the 862th episode of M jak Mi³oœæ, in which Hanka Mostowiak (Ma³gorzata Ko¿uchowska) had an accident, landing in a pile of cardboard boxes. The episode was vividly announced as "Hanka Mostowiak's Last Way". The episode turned out to be a hit: on the day of broadcasting it was watched by over 8 million viewers (!), Which is almost half of the people who had their TV on at that time. So far, the memorable scene is available on YouTube, where it has been recreated almost ... 2 million times! Strictly speaking, Hanka did not die in cardboard boxes right away. She died in the hospital because it turned out that she had a brain aneurysm that ruptured during the collision. Unfortunately, Marek (Kacper Kuszewski) was not with her, and her sister Ania (Tamara Arciuch) tried to help her. The women were returning from their parents' grave in Suwa³ki when a girl appeared on the road in front of Grabina. Terrified Hanka Mostowiak lost control of the vehicle and drove into the cardboard boxes. So far, it is not known where they came from. Although Hanka's death in cardboard boxes instantly became a meme (even Facebook events "Not for Hanka's burying at Wawel" were set up), it was speculated that "Hanka Mostowiak's last journey" was prophetic. Ko¿uchowska left the series in an atmosphere of distaste, wanting to break with her current image. It was said that Ilona £epkowska, the then screenwriter of M jak Mi³oœæ, was offended by this decision, and hence the heroine's grotesque death. At one point it was speculated that Hanka Mostowiak would return to M jak Mi³oœæ as a ghost. However, nobody wanted to be haunted by her and the idea was abandoned. What was happening with Ko¿uchowska during that time? She left M jak Mi³oœæ and starred in the crime series Nowa, but the production was canceled after one season. Then came Rodzinka.pl, Agata's Law, Second Chance and Patryk Vega's productions. Recently, Ma³gorzata Ko¿uchowska starred in a Catholic drama about Padre Pio, a drama about loans in francs Banksters, and next year we will see her in Gierek. The break with the image of Hanka must have been successful, especially after the scenes in Plagi Breslau: "GroŸna" Ko¿uchowska shows off her clumsy vocabulary in the trailer for the new Vega film: "What is this race? KU * WA SRAKA". In the meantime, Ko¿uchowska tried her strength in the theater, but her role in the cult play Kotek na hot, tin roof was crushed by critics. Recall: Englert does not want Ko¿uchowska in Narodowy? "This theater doesn't need a star." In September of this year, Ko¿uchowska returned to Narodowy, where she was entrusted with the title role of a possessed nun in a play based on a story by Jaros³aw Iwaszkiewicz, Mother Joan of the Angels. Until November, there were only eight performances, as theaters were again closed by a pandemic. Ko¿uchowska, therefore, was the social campaign We have a climate, in which it encourages the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roofs of single-family houses. Interestingly, Hanka Mostowiak played for less than 11 years in M ??jak Mi³oœæ. She first appeared in the second episode, which aired on November 11, 2000. She died four days before the eleventh anniversary of her debut. Do you miss?
